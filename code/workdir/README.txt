	Scyori
======================================

	The game
-------------------------------

Is being evil hard work? Scyori does it for a living and now you can have a go at it too.
There is a space station in the fringes of space that for some reason needs some destroying
applied to it. You can do it with plasma guns and stuff.

The game is still work in progress and I probably will update it when and if I have time to do so.
I had planned larger game but unfortunately did not have enough time to implement it.

	Troubleshooting
-------------------------------

Q: Missing MSVCR100.dll (or similar)
A: Install Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable. Download at: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555

Q: Something happened which is not listed in here. What do I do!?
A: If you can bother, you can send a report to my email: temu92@gmail.com. Please explain how and
   when it happened, what is/was the error description and how it can be reproduced.
